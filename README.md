## Learning Approach

Each package follows a structured learning path:
1. **Theory**: Basic examples and cheat sheets
2. **Practice**: Hands-on exercises
3. **Projects**: Comprehensive implementations combining multiple concepts

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository with `git clone git@github.com:dmitrykitty/learn-java-with-me.git`

2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA (or your preferred Java IDE)

3. Navigate to specific packages to explore different concepts

4. Run the `*Runner` classes to see examples in action

---

## Notes

- Most runner classes contain `static void main()` methods for demonstration
- Code emphasizes learning and experimentation over production-ready patterns
- Each package contains its own examples and exercises
- This is a personal learning repository showcasing my self-study approach to mastering Java programming.
