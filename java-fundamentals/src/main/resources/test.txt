I get caught in the water
I get torn in the wind
I could drown in the river
While the sun burns down

I get tossed by the ocean
Fall deep in the sand
I’m drowned out by the thunder
Lost in a laugh

Is anyone listening?
Is anyone around to see

That I’m doing it all for you
I’m doing it all for you
I’m ready to go
I’m ready to go
I’m doing it all for you
I’m doing it all for you
I’m ready to go
I’m ready to go

Twenty five seconds
Your heart will stop resting
Your body start shaking
Your mind is now ready to go
Ready to go

Twenty five seconds
Your heart will stop resting
Your body start shaking
Your mind is now ready to go
Ready to go

I said
Twenty five seconds
Your heart will stop resting
Your body start shaking
Your mind is now ready to go
Ready to go
