You have a LinkedList acting as storage for integers. A ProducerThread infinitely adds random integers to this list at
certain intervals, however, the maximum number of elements the list can hold is 10.

A ConsumerThread infinitely retrieves numbers from the list with a random delay (between 0 and 10 ms).

Implement the logic such that the produce method adds numbers only when the limit (10) is not exceeded,
and the consume method retrieves them only when the list contains at least one element.
Both methods must work correctly in a multithreaded environment (thread-safe).

Create and start two separate threads: one executing produce and the other executing consume.
Demonstrate the correctness of the storage operations by printing messages to the console regarding adding items,
retrieving items, and the current storage size during these operations.



Objective: Implement a thread-safe Producer-Consumer pattern using a LinkedList.
Requirements:

    Storage: Use a LinkedList<Integer> to store the values.

    Producer: Create a ProducerThread that infinitely adds random numbers to the list.
        Constraint: The maximum capacity of the list is 10. The producer must wait if the list is full.

    Consumer: Create a ConsumerThread that infinitely retrieves numbers from the list.
        Constraint: The consumer must wait if the list is empty.
        Delay: The consumer should have a random delay between 0 and 10 ms.

    Concurrency: Ensure the produce and consume methods are thread-safe and handle synchronization
    correctly (e.g., using wait() and notify()).

    Execution: Create and start both threads simultaneously.

    Logging: Print console messages for every operation to demonstrate correctness:
        When an item is added.
        When an item is retrieved.
        The current size of the storage after each operation.
